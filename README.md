# Universal Charts

In this project I implement what's new I learn in Android. Core module is external library [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart).
Around it is built this app. So, what interesting I've added here:

- Save data on device storage.
- Save data in a local database using [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room).
- Basic tryout in [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/documentation) UI.
